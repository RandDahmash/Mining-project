# Student Adaptability Level Classification

## Project Description
This project focuses on classifying students’ adaptability levels to online education using machine learning techniques. The objective is to predict whether a student’s adaptability is Low, Moderate, or High based on various demographic and academic features.  

The project involves:
	•	Exploring the dataset and understanding its features.  
	•	Applying classification algorithms in python to predict students’ adaptability levels.  
	•	Analyzing performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## Project Motivation
Online education has become an essential part of modern learning, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, not all students adapt equally well to virtual environments. The project aims to study adaptability levels in order to:
	•	Identify students who may need extra support.
	•	Provide institutions with insights to improve learning strategies.
	•	Highlight factors that influence adaptability and improve online education systems.

This topic matters because it directly connects to education quality and student success in today’s digital era.
