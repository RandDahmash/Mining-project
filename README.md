# Student Adaptability Level Classification

## Project Description
This project focuses on classifying students’ adaptability levels to online education using machine learning techniques. The objective is to predict whether a student’s adaptability is Low, Moderate, or High based on various demographic and academic features.  

The project involves:
- Exploring the dataset and understanding its features.  
- Applying classification algorithms to predict adaptability levels.  
- Analyzing performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## Project Motivation
Online education has become an essential part of modern learning, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, not all students adapt equally well to virtual environments. Being able to classify students’ adaptability levels helps:  
- Educators provide additional support to students struggling with online formats.  
- Institutions design better learning strategies tailored to student needs.  
- Researchers understand factors that affect adaptability and improve e-learning systems.  

This problem is important because it connects directly to the quality of education and student success in a digital era.
